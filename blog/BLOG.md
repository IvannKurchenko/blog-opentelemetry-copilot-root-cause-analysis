# OpenTelemetry Copilot: Root Cause Analysis

### Abstract
This blog post opens a short series of articles about applying Large Language Models (LLM) to use it for analyzing observability
data supplied by OpenTelemetry (OTEL) framework. The main goal the series is trying to achieve is to find out how to use LLM
to help automate or help in resolving tedious and repetitive work such as incident response, root cause analysis and 
post-mortem investigations.

Although LLMs play a central role in a final solution, a number of related frameworks, such as Agents and Model Context Protocol (MCP),
and techniques like prompt engineering will be used.
